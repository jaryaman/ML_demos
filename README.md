# ML_demos
A collection of machine learning techniques

## Directories

### Data

Datasets which are used in the demonstrations. A number of datasets are taken from here: https://github.com/probml/pmtk3

### Notebooks

A set of Jupyter notebooks and helper modules providing demonstrations of some machine learning techniques. Click on the file to read the notebook.

- `expectation_maximization_GMM.ipynb`: Using the expectation maximization algorithm to fit a Gaussian mixture model to two clusters of data
- `gaussian_processes.ipynb`: Using Gaussian processes for non-parametric regression
- `factor_analysis.ipynb`: Giving an illustration of probabilistic principal component analysis, and using a full factor analysis model to perform dimensionality reduction on a car feature dataset.
- `independent_component_analysis.ipynb` : Exploration of latent linear models using independent component analysis in comparison to principal component analysis.
