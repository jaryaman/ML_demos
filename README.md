# ML_demos
A collection of machine learning techniques

## Directories

### Data

Datasets which are used in the demonstrations. A number of datasets are taken from here: https://github.com/probml/pmtk3

### Notebooks

A set of Jupyter notebooks and helper modules providing demonstrations of some machine learning techniques. Click on the file to read the notebook.
